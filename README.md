#PI2Arduino
This project is at its early stages of development. Many tutorials are already out there to get the Raspberry Pi and Arduino to communicate. My goal is to create a heavily commented structure of what is needed. I went with using Node.js because I wanted to make the Arduino respond to Twitter. That was my first though, but now that I have looking into it it seems that there is more potential then just Twitter.

##Current Standings
I currently have 4 buttons in an html file that are used to controll the color of my RGB LED that is connected to my Arduino.

##Prerequisits
1. Arduino Uno (I am using R3)
2. Raspberry Pi (Model B) that is already booted
3. Node.js, Socket.IO, and serialPort installed on the Raspberry Pi (Will Cover tutorial later)
