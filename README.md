Arduino communicating with Node.js Experiment.
To make this work you will need to download the socket.io and serialPort modules in the node_modules folder. 

The application is run by executing index.js (node index.js)

THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT AND THEREFORE FAR FROM PERFECT!

Credit goes to Barry.

I, Will, have edited his version to suit my needs. All I really did was change the arduino code.
I made it more user friendly. Instead of a potentiometer and two LED's I used one RGB LED connected
to PWM pins and 5V.
